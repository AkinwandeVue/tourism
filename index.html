            <h5>Re-orientation of youths on Tourism</h5>
            <p>However, Nigeria has in the recent time gained reasonable income through its unique environment, 
              from both local and International tourism. It is therefore vital to recognize and support one of 
              the world’s fastest growing tourism sector; The Youth Tourism Sector, which have, as it were, the 
              capabilities of reforming  Nigeria, onto Economic- Tourism-Bracket Train. It is for this purpose 
              that, “THE GLOBAL INITIATIVE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUTH TOURISM, (YTI); a full incorporated 
              Non-Governmental Organization is espousing the concept of Youth Tourism Development and Promotion, 
              as a platform for a sustainable tourism master plan initiative.
            </p> <p>
                Additionally, in our objectives of serving as the foundation through which the “evangelism” of 
                youth tourism development is harnessed to achieving sustainable global business tourism, create 
                database and research platform that would evaluate future tourism action plans, also, redirect 
                the minds of Individuals, Private Sector Stakeholders, Private establishments, International 
                agencies, and Governments, towards investing in tourism, especially in the Youth Tourism Sector.
                </p><p>
                Hence, in order to activate commercialization platforms of this almost untapped source of 
                national income, and perhaps, through the establishment of Nigeria’s Youth Tourism Clubs; 
                integrate these mobilized  youth within localized skills acquisition  activities as tour-guides, 
                practitioners of Arts and Crafts,etc and thus build platforms for self- reliance  through 
                self-employment ,with the attendant effect on our presently high unemployment figures, we 
                welcome you to our site and  wish you are inspired by our actions and  plans towards building 
                a Dream of Hope and Future for our energetic youths. Do have a happy view.</p>
